# About Leigh 
Leigh works as a navigator for the lost at some governmental agency plotting streets and unknown pipeline content, making maps, and performing spatial analysis. She thinks she will start a blog about being vegan... or paleo... in Italy.

# About Tom 
Tom works as a covert operative for some undisclosed international governmental agency somewhere in Europe. Sometimes he is on a boat. In his free time he likes to ping robots.

# How We Met...
Cyndee decided to try her hand at match making during a trip to Ireland with Tom. She told Leigh and Tom to check out each other's Facebook page as we might like each other. Tom and Leigh officially met two days after New Year's Eve 2013 at The Field. The first date happened the next day and lasted for 9 hours. We have never looked back.

# What's Next?
We can't wait to spend the rest of our lives getting to know each other, talking it out, and keeping it real. Leigh just joined Tom in Italia, and we're excited to be spending more time together.
