# About Leigh 
Leigh works as a navigator for the lost at some governmental agency plotting streets and unknown pipeline content, making maps, and performing spatial analysis.
She thinks she will start a blog about being vegan... or paleo... in Italy.

# About Tom 
Tom works as a covert operative for some undisclosed international governmental agency somewhere in Europe.
Sometimes he is on a boat.
In his free time he likes to ping robots.

# How We Met...
Out mutual friend Cyndee decided to try her hand at match making.
She told us each to perform some prerequisite Facebook stalking as we might like each other.
All parties were interested, and we first met on an awkward chaperoned date with friends.
Our first date was the next day and lasted for 9 hours, and we haven't looked back (too much) since.

# What's Next?
We can't wait to spend the rest of our lives getting to know each other, talking it out, and generally figuring it out.
We have recently initiated co-habitation in Italia, and we're excited to be spending more time together.
