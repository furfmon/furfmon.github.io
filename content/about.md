# About Leigh 
Leigh works as a navigator for the lost at some governmental agency plotting streets and unknown pipeline content, making maps, and performing spatial analysis. She thinks she will start a blog about being vegan in Italy.
Leigh's first impression: wicked hot eyes... thank god he is tall and smart... 

# About Tom 
Tom works as a covert operative for some undisclosed international governmental agency somewhere in Europe. Sometimes he is on a boat. In his free time he likes to ping robots.

# How We Met...
Cyndee decided to try her hand at match making and told me to go check out Tom's Facebook page. We officially met two days after New Year's Eve 2013 at The Field. Our first date happened the next day and lasted for 9 hours. We have never looked back.

# What's Next?
We can't wait to spend the rest of our lives getting to know each other, talking it out, and keeping it real. Also practicing yoga.
The next step is moving Leigh across an ocean...
