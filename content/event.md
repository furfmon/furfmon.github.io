The ceremony and reception will both be co-located on the property of the Old Davie School Historical Museum.

> The Davie School, designed in 1917 by August Geiger, one of South Florida's most prominent early architects, opened its doors in 1918 to roughly 90 students.
This historic structure was the first permanent school in the Everglades and is now Broward County's oldest existing school building.
The building was in continuous use as a school until 1980.
From the day it opened, the Davie School served as the area's source of education as well as a center for community gatherings.
In 1988 the Davie School achieved listing on the National Register of Historic Places.
