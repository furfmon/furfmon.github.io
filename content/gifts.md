We are fortunate in our life together to have all the things we need, especially as we have just merged households.
So, we would kindly ask that if you are set on gift-giving, but donâ€™t have any ideas, that you invest in our future together with a monetary contribution to the Furfaro-Ammon household.
However, if you prefer to purchase a gift, feel free to surprise us in your own way, keeping in mind that we live in another country, across an ocean.

We are investigating options for collecting contributions in a more organized, technologic way, but in the meantime, please sit tight!
